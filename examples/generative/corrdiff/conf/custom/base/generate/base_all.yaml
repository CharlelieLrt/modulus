inference_mode: all
# Choose between "all" (regression + diffusion), "regression" or "diffusion"
boundary_pixels: 2
# Number of boundary pixels to be cropped out. 2 is recommanded to address the boundary
# artifact.
hr_mean_conditioning: true
sample_res: full
# Sampling resolution
times_range: null

perf:
  force_fp16: false
    # Whether to force fp16 precision for the model. If false, it'll use the precision
    # specified upon training.
  use_torch_compile: false
    # whether to use torch.compile on the diffusion model
    # this will make the first time stamp generation very slow due to compilation overheads
    # but will significantly speed up subsequent inference runs
  num_writer_workers: 1
    # number of workers to use for writing file
    # To support multiple workers a threadsafe version of the netCDF library must be used
